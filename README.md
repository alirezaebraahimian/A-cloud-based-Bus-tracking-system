The real-time tracking system for both urban and intercity buses operates through a central control hub that persistently monitors the status of all buses. This system gathers the current conditions of all buses via the internet, records this data in one or several databases, and then begins analyzing it to facilitate user services. The data includes specifics such as the precise location of each bus, passenger counts, fuel usage, passenger feedback on drivers, and the mechanical state of the buses, among other details. With this system, the control center can accurately and instantaneously understand the operational performance of the buses and effectively manage public transport systems.
The implementation of this urban and intercity bus monitoring system brings substantial advantages to the public transit network. It allows public transport leaders to accurately and promptly monitor the buses' operational statuses, enabling them to make better-informed decisions about the transport network's management. Using the system's collected data, there can be enhancements in drivers' performance and bus services. For instance, by analyzing passenger numbers per bus, the system can better allocate buses across routes during peak times. Additionally, allowing passengers to rate their drivers helps monitor and improve driver interactions, raising the quality of service. Furthermore, the system benefits passengers by providing real-time bus status information, allowing them to plan their station arrivals more precisely and avoid lengthy, uncomfortable waits.
The architecture of this project consists of three main components: 1. Server 2. Buses 3. Users.
Bus: Each bus acts as a Publisher, constantly sending its data to the server. This data includes precise geographic location, the number of people on the bus, the driver's name, the driver's photo, and the last time the data was sent. In a real-world scenario, this client would be implemented on an embedded system. However, for the purposes of cloud computing coursework, where implementing an actual embedded system is not required, a Python script named busClient.py has been created to simulate the function of this component of the system.
User: The user acts as a Subscriber, receiving needed services from the server. Typically, these services are accessed via an application on Android and iOS smartphones. However, due to time constraints in project delivery, a Python script called appClient.py has been developed to implement the function of this system component.
Server: The server communicates with both buses and users using sockets. The server's code, named Server.py, is implemented in Python. In this project, the server includes several parts:
  a) The execution code of the program (virtual machine on Ferdowsi cloud)
  b) Databases (a relational local SQLite database on Ferdowsi cloud and a non-relational cloud database in MongoDB)
  c) File storage (Arvan cloud object storage)
  d) APIs
